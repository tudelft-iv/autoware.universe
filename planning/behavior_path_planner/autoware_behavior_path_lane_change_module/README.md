# Lane Change design

The Lane Change module is activated when lane change is needed and can be safely executed.

## Lane Change Requirement

- As the prerequisite, the type of lane boundary in the HD map has to be one of the following:
  - Dashed lane marking: Lane changes are permitted in both directions.
  - Dashed marking on the left and solid on the right: Lane changes are allowed from left to right.
  - Dashed marking on the right and solid on the left: Lane changes are allowed from right to left.
  - `allow_lane_change` tags is set as `true`
- During lane change request condition
  - The ego-vehicle isn’t on a `preferred_lane`.
  - The ego-vehicle isn't approaching a traffic light. (condition parameterized)
  - The ego-vehicle isn't approaching a crosswalk. (condition parameterized)
  - The ego-vehicle isn't approaching an intersection. (condition parameterized)
- lane change ready condition
  - Path of the lane change does not collide with other dynamic objects (see the figure below)
  - Lane change candidate path is approved by an operator.

## Generating Lane Change Candidate Path

The lane change candidate path is divided into two phases: preparation and lane-changing. The following figure illustrates each phase of the lane change candidate path.

![lane-change-phases](./images/lane_change-lane_change_phases.png)

The following chart illustrates the process of sampling candidate paths for lane change.

```plantuml

  #LightPink:Return prev approved path;

  if (Is LC start point outside target lanes range) then (yes)
    if (Is found a valid path) then (yes)
      #Orange:Return first valid path;
      stop
    else (no)
      #LightPink:Return prev approved path;
      stop
    endif
  else (no)
  endif

    if (Is valid candidate path?) then (yes)
      :Store candidate path;
      if (Is candidate path safe?) then (yes)
        #LightGreen:Return candidate path;
        stop
      else (no)
      endif
    else (no)
    endif
    repeat while (Finished looping shift phase metrics) is (FALSE)
  repeat while (Is finished looping prepare phase metrics) is (FALSE)

if (Is found a valid path) then (yes)
  #Orange:Return first valid path;
  stop

endif

#LightPink:Return prev approved path;
stop

@enduml
```

While the following chart demonstrates the process of generating a valid candidate path.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center
skinparam backgroundColor #WHITE

start

:Calculate resample interval;

:Get reference path from target lanes;

if (Is reference path empty?) then (yes)
  #LightPink:Return;
  stop
else (no)
endif

:Get LC shift line;

:Set lane change Info;
note left: set information from sampled prepare phase and shift phase metrics\n<color:red>(duration, length, velocity, and acceleration)

:Construct candidate path;

if (Candidate path has enough length?) then (yes)
  #LightGreen:Return valid candidate path;
  stop
else (no)
  #LightPink:Return;
  stop
endif

@enduml
```

### Preparation phase

The preparation trajectory is the candidate path's first and the straight portion generated along the ego vehicle's current lane. The length of the preparation trajectory is computed as follows.

```C++
lane_change_prepare_distance = current_speed * lane_change_prepare_duration + 0.5 * deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration^2
```

During the preparation phase, the turn signal will be activated when the remaining distance is equal to or less than `lane_change_search_distance`.

### Lane-changing phase

The lane-changing phase consist of the shifted path that moves ego from current lane to the target lane. Total distance of lane-changing phase is as follows. Note that during the lane changing phase, the ego vehicle travels at a constant speed.

```C++
lane_change_prepare_velocity = std::max(current_speed + deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration, minimum_lane_changing_velocity)
lane_changing_distance = lane_change_prepare_velocity * lane_changing_duration
```

The `backward_length_buffer_for_end_of_lane` is added to allow some window for any possible delay, such as control or mechanical delay during brake lag.

#### Multiple candidate path samples (longitudinal acceleration)

Lane change velocity is affected by the ego vehicle's current velocity. High velocity requires longer preparation and lane changing distance. However we also need to plan lane changing trajectories in case ego vehicle slows down.
Computing candidate paths that assumes ego vehicle's slows down is performed by substituting predetermined deceleration value into `prepare_length`, `prepare_velocity` and `lane_changing_length` equation.

The predetermined longitudinal acceleration values are a set of value that starts from `longitudinal_acceleration = maximum_longitudinal_acceleration`, and decrease by `longitudinal_acceleration_resolution` until it reaches `longitudinal_acceleration = -maximum_longitudinal_deceleration`. Both `maximum_longitudinal_acceleration` and `maximum_longitudinal_deceleration` are calculated as: defined in the `common.param` file as `normal.min_acc`.

```C++
maximum_longitudinal_acceleration = min(common_param.max_acc, lane_change_param.max_acc)
maximum_longitudinal_deceleration = max(common_param.min_acc, lane_change_param.min_acc)
```

where `common_param` is vehicle common parameter, which defines vehicle common maximum longitudinal acceleration and deceleration. Whereas, `lane_change_param` has maximum longitudinal acceleration and deceleration for the lane change module. For example, if a user set and `common_param.max_acc=1.0` and `lane_change_param.max_acc=0.0`, `maximum_longitudinal_acceleration` becomes `0.0`, and the lane change does not accelerate in the lane change phase.

The `longitudinal_acceleration_resolution` is determine by the following

```C++
longitudinal_acceleration_resolution = (maximum_longitudinal_acceleration - minimum_longitudinal_acceleration) / longitudinal_acceleration_sampling_num
```

Note that when the `current_velocity` is lower than `minimum_lane_changing_velocity`, the vehicle needs to accelerate its velocity to `minimum_lane_changing_velocity`. Therefore, longitudinal acceleration becomes positive value (not decelerate).

The chart illustrates the conditions under which longitudinal acceleration values are sampled.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center
skinparam backgroundColor #WHITE

start

if (prev_module_path is empty?) then (yes)
  :Return empty list;
  stop
else (no)
endif

if (max_acc <= 0.0) then (yes)
  :Return **sampled acceleration values**;
  note left: Calculated sampled acceleration using\n<color:red>getAccelerationValues(min_acc, max_acc, longitudinal_acc_sampling_num)</color>
  stop
endif

if (max_lane_change_length >  ego's distance to the end of the current lanes.) then (yes)
  :Return **sampled acceleration values**;
  stop
endif

if (ego is stuck in the current lanes) then (yes)
  :Return **sampled acceleration values**;
  stop
else (no)
endif

if (is goal is in target lanes) then (yes)
  if (max_lane_change_length < ego's distance to the goal along the target lanes) then (yes)
    :Return {max_acc};
    stop
  else (no)
  endif
else (no)
  if (max_lane_change_length < ego's distance to the end of the target lanes.) then (yes)
    :Return {max_acc};
    stop
  else (no)
  endif
endif

:Return **sampled acceleration values**;
stop

@enduml

```

while the following describes the process by which longitudinal accelerations are sampled.

```plantuml
@startuml
start
:Initialize sampled_values with min_acc;

if (min_acc > max_acc) then (yes)
  :Return empty list;
  stop
elseif (max_acc - min_acc < epsilon) then (yes)
  :Return {0.0};
  stop
else (no)
  :Calculate resolution;
endif

:Start loop from min_acc to max_acc with resolution step;
repeat
  if (sampled_values.back() < -epsilon AND next_value > epsilon) then (yes)
    :Insert 0.0 into sampled_values;
  endif
  :Add sampled_acc to sampled_values;
  repeat while (sampled_acc < max_acc + epsilon) is (TRUE)

:Return sampled_values;
stop
@enduml
```

The following figure illustrates when `longitudinal_acceleration_sampling_num = 4`. Assuming that `maximum_deceleration = 1.0` then `a0 == 0.0 == no deceleration`, `a1 == 0.25`, `a2 == 0.5`, `a3 == 0.75` and `a4 == 1.0 == maximum_deceleration`. `a0` is the expected lane change trajectories should ego vehicle do not decelerate, and `a1`'s path is the expected lane change trajectories should ego vehicle decelerate at `0.25 m/s^2`.

![path_samples](./images/lane_change-candidate_path_samples.png)

Which path will be chosen will depend on validity and collision check.

#### Multiple candidate path samples (lateral acceleration)

In addition to sampling longitudinal acceleration, we also sample lane change paths by adjusting the value of lateral acceleration. Since lateral acceleration influences the duration of a lane change, a lower lateral acceleration value results in a longer lane change path, while a higher lateral acceleration value leads to a shorter lane change path. This allows the lane change module to generate a shorter lane change path by increasing the lateral acceleration when there is limited space for the lane change.

The maximum and minimum lateral accelerations are defined in the lane change parameter file as a map. The range of lateral acceleration is determined for each velocity by linearly interpolating the values in the map. Let's assume we have the following map

| Ego Velocity | Minimum lateral acceleration | Maximum lateral acceleration |
| :----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.0          | 0.2                          | 0.3                          |
| 2.0          | 0.2                          | 0.4                          |
| 4.0          | 0.3                          | 0.4                          |
| 6.0          | 0.3                          | 0.5                          |

In this case, when the current velocity of the ego vehicle is 3.0, the minimum and maximum lateral accelerations are 0.25 and 0.4 respectively. These values are obtained by linearly interpolating the second and third rows of the map, which provide the minimum and maximum lateral acceleration values.

Within this range, we sample the lateral acceleration for the ego vehicle. Similar to the method used for sampling longitudinal acceleration, the resolution of lateral acceleration (lateral_acceleration_resolution) is determined by the following:

```C++
lateral_acceleration_resolution = (maximum_lateral_acceleration - minimum_lateral_acceleration) / lateral_acceleration_sampling_num
```

#### Candidate Path's validity check

A candidate path is considered valid if it meets the following criteria:

1. The distance from the ego vehicle's current position to the end of the current lanes is sufficient to perform a single lane change.
2. The distance from the ego vehicle's current position to the goal along the current lanes is adequate to complete multiple lane changes.
3. The distance from the ego vehicle's current position to the end of the target lanes is adequate for completing multiple lane changes.
4. The distance from the ego vehicle's current position to the next regulatory element is adequate to perform a single lane change.
5. The lane change can be completed after passing a parked vehicle.
6. The lane change is deemed safe to execute.

The following flow chart illustrates the validity check.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center
skinparam backgroundColor #White

start
if (Check if start point is valid by check if it is covered by neighbour lanes polygon) then (not covered)
  #LightPink:Reject path;
  stop
else (covered)
endif

    :Calculate total length and goal related distances;
    if (total lane change length considering single lane change > distance from current pose to end of current lanes) then (yes)
      #LightPink:Reject path;
      stop
    else (no)
    endif

    if (goal is in current lanes) then (yes)
      if (total lane change length considering multiple lane changes > distance from ego to goal along current lanes) then (yes)
         #LightPink:Reject path;
        stop
      else (no)
      endif
    else (no)
    endif

    if (target lanes is empty) then (yes)
      #LightPink:Reject path;
      stop
    else (no)
    endif
    if (total lane change length considering multiple lane changes  > distance from ego to the end of target lanes) then (yes)
      #LightPink:Reject path;
      stop
    else (no)
    endif
end group

if (ego is not stuck but parked vehicle exists in target lane) then (yes)
  #LightPink:Reject path;
  stop
else (no)
endif

if (is safe to perform lane change) then (yes)
  #Cyan:Return candidate path list;
  stop
else (no)
  #LightPink:Reject path;
endif

stop

@enduml
```

#### Candidate Path's Safety check

See [safety check utils explanation](../autoware_behavior_path_planner_common/docs/behavior_path_planner_safety_check.md)

#### Objects selection and classification

First, we divide the target objects into obstacles in the target lane, obstacles in the current lane, and obstacles in other lanes. Target lane indicates the lane that the ego vehicle is going to reach after the lane change and current lane mean the current lane where the ego vehicle is following before the lane change. Other lanes are lanes that do not belong to the target and current lanes. The following picture describes objects on each lane. Note that users can remove objects either on current and other lanes from safety check by changing the flag, which are `check_objects_on_current_lanes` and `check_objects_on_other_lanes`.

![object lanes](./images/lane_objects.drawio.svg)

Furthermore, to change lanes behind a vehicle waiting at a traffic light, we skip the safety check for the stopping vehicles near the traffic light. The explanation for parked car detection is written in [documentation for avoidance module](../autoware_behavior_path_static_obstacle_avoidance_module/README.md).

The detection area for the target lane can be expanded beyond its original boundaries to enable detection of objects that are outside the target lane's limits.

##### Collision check in prepare phase

The ego vehicle may need to secure ample inter-vehicle distance ahead of the target vehicle before attempting a lane change. The flag `enable_collision_check_at_prepare_phase` can be enabled to gain this behavior. The following image illustrates the differences between the `false` and `true` cases.

![enable collision check at prepare phase](./images/lane_change-enable_collision_check_at_prepare_phase.png)

The parameter `prepare_phase_ignore_target_speed_thresh` can be configured to ignore the prepare phase collision check for targets whose speeds are less than a specific threshold, such as stationary or very slow-moving objects.

#### If the lane is blocked and multiple lane changes

When driving on the public road with other vehicles, there exist scenarios where lane changes cannot be executed. Suppose the candidate path is evaluated as unsafe, for example, due to incoming vehicles in the adjacent lane. In that case, the ego vehicle can't change lanes, and it is impossible to reach the goal. Therefore, the ego vehicle must stop earlier at a certain distance and wait for the adjacent lane to be evaluated as safe. The minimum stopping distance can be computed from shift length and minimum lane changing velocity.

```C++
lane_changing_time = f(shift_length, lat_acceleration, lat_jerk)
minimum_lane_change_distance = minimum_prepare_length + minimum_lane_changing_velocity * lane_changing_time + lane_change_finish_judge_buffer
```

The following figure illustrates when the lane is blocked in multiple lane changes cases.

![multiple-lane-changes](./images/lane_change-when_cannot_change_lanes.png)

### Stopping behavior

The stopping behavior of the ego vehicle is determined based on various factors, such as the number of lane changes required, the presence of obstacles, and the position of blocking objects in relation to the lane change plan. The objective is to choose a suitable stopping point that allows for a safe and effective lane change while adapting to different traffic scenarios.

The following flowchart and subsections explain the conditions for deciding where to insert a stop point when an obstacle is ahead.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center
skinparam backgroundColor #WHITE

title Inserting Stop Point

start
if (number of lane changes is zero?) then (<color:green><b>YES</b></color>)
stop
else (<color:red><b>NO</b></color>)
endif

if (do we want to insert stop point in current lanes?) then (<color:red><b>NO</b></color>)
#LightPink:Insert stop point at next lane change terminal start.;
stop
else (<color:green><b>YES</b></color>)
endif

if (Is there leading object in the current lanes that blocks ego's path?) then (<color:red><b>NO</b></color>)
#LightPink:Insert stop point at terminal stop.;
stop
else (<color:green><b>YES</b></color>)
endif

if (Blocking object's position is after target lane's start position?) then (<color:red><b>NO</b></color>)
#LightPink:Insert stop at the target lane's start position.;
stop
else (<color:green><b>YES</b></color>)
endif

if (Blocking object's position is before terminal stop position?) then (<color:red><b>NO</b></color>)
#LightPink:Insert stop at the terminal stop position;
stop
else (<color:green><b>YES</b></color>)
endif

if (Are there target lane objects between the ego and the blocking object?) then (<color:red><b>NO</b></color>)
#LightGreen:Insert stop behind the blocking object;
stop
else (<color:green><b>YES</b></color>)
#LightPink:Insert stop at terminal stop;
stop
@enduml
```

#### Ego vehicle's stopping position when an object exists ahead

When the ego vehicle encounters an obstacle ahead, it stops while maintaining a safe distance to prepare for a possible lane change. The exact stopping position depends on factors like whether the target lane is clear or if the lane change needs to be delayed. The following explains how different stopping scenarios are handled:

##### When the near the end of the lane change

Whether the target lane has obstacles or is clear, the ego vehicle stops while keeping a safe distance from the obstacle ahead, ensuring there is enough room for the lane change.

![stop_at_terminal_no_block](./images/lane_change-stop_at_terminal_no_block.drawio.svg)

![stop_at_terminal](./images/lane_change-stop_at_terminal.drawio.svg)

##### When the ego vehicle is not near the end of the lane change

The ego vehicle stops while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle ahead, ensuring there is enough space for a lane change.

![stop_not_at_terminal_no_blocking_object](./images/lane_change-stop_not_at_terminal_no_blocking_object.drawio.svg)

#### Ego vehicle's stopping position when an object exists in the lane changing section

If there are objects within the lane change section of the target lane, the ego vehicle stops closer to the obstacle ahead, without maintaining the usual distance for a lane change.

##### When near the end of the lane change

Regardless of whether there are obstacles in the target lane, the ego vehicle stops while keeping a safe distance from the obstacle ahead, allowing for the lane change.

![stop_at_terminal_no_block](./images/lane_change-stop_at_terminal_no_block.drawio.svg)

![stop_at_terminal](./images/lane_change-stop_at_terminal.drawio.svg)

##### When not near the end of the lane change

If there are no obstacles in the lane change section of the target lane, the ego vehicle stops while keeping a safe distance from the obstacle ahead to accommodate the lane change.

![stop_not_at_terminal_no_blocking_object](./images/lane_change-stop_not_at_terminal_no_blocking_object.drawio.svg)

If there are obstacles within the lane change section of the target lane, the ego vehicle stops closer to the obstacle ahead, without keeping the usual distance needed for a lane change.

![stop_not_at_terminal](./images/lane_change-stop_not_at_terminal.drawio.svg)

#### When the target lane is far away

If the target lane for the lane change is far away and not next to the current lane, the ego vehicle stops closer to the obstacle ahead, as maintaining the usual distance for a lane change is not necessary.

![stop_far_from_target_lane](./images/lane_change-stop_far_from_target_lane.drawio.svg)

![stop_not_at_terminal](./images/lane_change-stop_not_at_terminal.drawio.svg)

### Lane Change When Stuck

The ego vehicle is considered stuck if it is stopped and meets any of the following conditions:

- There is an obstacle in front of the current lane
- The ego vehicle is at the end of the current lane

In this case, the safety check for lane change is relaxed compared to normal times.
Please refer to the 'stuck' section under the 'Collision checks during lane change' for more details.
The function to stop by keeping a margin against forward obstacle in the previous section is being performed to achieve this feature.

### Lane change regulations

If you want to regulate lane change on crosswalks, intersections, or traffic lights, the lane change module is disabled near any of them.
To regulate lane change on crosswalks, intersections, or traffic lights, set `regulation.crosswalk`, `regulation.intersection` or `regulation.traffic_light` to `true`.
If the ego vehicle gets stuck, to avoid stuck, it enables lane change in crosswalk/intersection.
If the ego vehicle stops more than `stuck_detection.stop_time` seconds, it is regarded as a stuck.
If the ego vehicle velocity is smaller than `stuck_detection.velocity`, it is regarded as stopping.

### Aborting lane change

The abort process may result in three different outcome; Cancel, Abort and Stop/Cruise.

The following depicts the flow of the abort lane change check.

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center

title Abort Lane Change

while(Lane Following)
  if (Lane Change required) then (**YES**)
    if (Safe to change lane) then (**SAFE**)
      while(Lane Changing)
        if (Lane Change Completed) then (**YES**)
        break
        else (**NO**)
          if (Is Abort Condition Satisfied) then (**NO**)
          else (**YES**)
            if (Is Enough margin to retry lane change) then (**YES**)
              if (Ego is on lane change prepare phase) then (**YES**)
              :Cancel lane change;
              break
              else (**NO**)
              if (Will the overhang to target lane be less than threshold?) then (**YES**)
              :Perform abort maneuver;
              break
              else (NO)
              :Stop or Cruise depending on the situation;
              endif
            endif
          else (**NO**)
          endif
        endif
        endif
      :Stop and wait;
      endwhile
    else (**UNSAFE**)
    endif
  else (**NO**)
  endif
endwhile
-[hidden]->
detach
@enduml

During a lane change, a safety check is made in consideration of the deceleration of the ego vehicle, and a safety check is made for `cancel.deceleration_sampling_num` deceleration patterns, and the lane change will be canceled if the abort condition is satisfied for all deceleration patterns.

To preventive measure for lane change path oscillations caused by alternating safe and unsafe conditions, an additional hysteresis count check is implemented before executing an abort or cancel maneuver. If unsafe, the `unsafe_hysteresis_count_` is incremented and compared against `unsafe_hysteresis_threshold`; exceeding it prompts an abort condition check, ensuring decisions are made with consideration to recent safety assessments as shown in flow chart above. This mechanism stabilizes decision-making, preventing abrupt changes due to transient unsafe conditions.

#### Cancel

Suppose the lane change trajectory is evaluated as unsafe. In that case, if the ego vehicle has not departed from the current lane yet, the trajectory will be reset, and the ego vehicle will resume the lane following the maneuver.

The function can be enabled by setting `enable_on_prepare_phase` to `true`.

The following image illustrates the cancel process.

#### Abort

Assume the ego vehicle has already departed from the current lane. In that case, it is dangerous to cancel the path, and it will cause the ego vehicle to change the heading direction abruptly. In this case, planning a trajectory that allows the ego vehicle to return to the current path while minimizing the heading changes is necessary. In this case, the lane change module will generate an abort path. The following images show an example of the abort path. Do note that the function DOESN'T GUARANTEE a safe abort process, as it didn't check the presence of the surrounding objects and/or their reactions. The function can be enable manually by setting both `enable_on_prepare_phase` and `enable_on_lane_changing_phase` to `true`. The parameter `max_lateral_jerk` need to be set to a high value in order for it to work.

#### Stop/Cruise

The last behavior will also occur if the ego vehicle has departed from the current lane. If the abort function is disabled or the abort is no longer possible, the ego vehicle will attempt to stop or transition to the obstacle cruise mode. Do note that the module DOESN'T GUARANTEE safe maneuver due to the unexpected behavior that might've occurred during these critical scenarios. The following images illustrate the situation.

## Lane change completion checks

To determine if the ego vehicle has successfully changed lanes, one of two criteria must be met: either the longitudinal or the lateral criteria.

For the longitudinal criteria, the ego vehicle must pass the lane-changing end pose and be within the `finish_judge_buffer` distance from it. The module then checks if the ego vehicle is in the target lane. If true, the module returns success. This check ensures that the planner manager updates the root lanelet correctly based on the ego vehicle's current pose. Without this check, if the ego vehicle is changing lanes while avoiding an obstacle and its current pose is in the original lane, the planner manager might set the root lanelet as the original lane. This would force the ego vehicle to perform the lane change again. With the target lane check, the ego vehicle is confirmed to be in the target lane, and the planner manager can correctly update the root lanelets.

If the longitudinal criteria are not met, the module evaluates the lateral criteria. For the lateral criteria, the ego vehicle must be within `finish_judge_lateral_threshold` distance from the target lane's centerline, and the angle deviation must be within `finish_judge_lateral_angle_deviation` degrees. The angle deviation check ensures there is no sudden steering. If the angle deviation is set too high, the ego vehicle's orientation could deviate significantly from the centerline, causing the trajectory follower to aggressively correct the steering to return to the centerline. Keeping the angle deviation value as small as possible avoids this issue.

The process of determining lane change completion is shown in the following diagram.

## Debug Marker & Visualization

To enable the debug marker, execute (no restart is needed)

```shell
ros2 param set /planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_path_planner lane_change.publish_debug_marker true

```

or simply set the `publish_debug_marker` to `true` in the `lane_change.param.yaml` for permanent effect (restart is needed).

Then add the marker

```shell
/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_path_planner/debug/lane_change_left
```

in `rviz2`.
